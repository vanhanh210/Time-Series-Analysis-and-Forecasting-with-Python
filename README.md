## Introduction

This repository contains a time series analysis and forecasting project that focuses on analyzing historical sales data and making future sales predictions for a retail business. The project utilizes Python and popular libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Statsmodels to perform the analysis and generate forecasts.

This project focuses on Time Series Analysis and Forecasting in the context of the retail business. Time series analysis is crucial for businesses to make informed decisions, optimize inventory, and enhance customer satisfaction. In this project,  I aim to achieve the following objectives:

- Understand and uncover sales patterns and trends over time.
- Make accurate forecasts to anticipate future sales.
- Provide valuable insights to optimize inventory management and resource allocation.
- Address the challenges of seasonality, trends, and anomalies in the retail sector.

## Data

### Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project consists of historical sales data for the retail business. It includes timestamps of sales transactions, sales figures, and additional relevant variables. The data is provided in a structured format, which is essential for time series analysis. This dataset is crucial for understanding historical sales trends and patterns, forming the foundation of our forecasting models.

## Analysis

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In the exploratory data analysis phase (EDA), i delve deep into the dataset to gain valuable insights:

- **Summary Statistics:** i calculate key statistical measures to understand the central tendencies and variability of sales data.
- **Data Visualization:** Utilizing time series plots, histograms, and other visualization techniques, i present the sales data in an interpretable manner.
- **Identification of Outliers or Anomalies:** i detect outliers or anomalies that might affect the accuracy of our analysis and take appropriate measures to address them.

### Seasonal Decomposition

To gain a deeper understanding of our sales data, i perform seasonal decomposition. This process involves breaking down the time series into its fundamental components:

- **Trends:** Identifying long-term patterns or trends in sales data.
- **Seasonality:** Detecting recurring patterns, such as daily, iekly, or monthly seasonality.
- **Residuals:** Examining the remaining irregularities in the data after removing trends and seasonality.

Seasonal decomposition helps us uncover the underlying patterns and structure within the time series, which is essential for accurate forecasting.

## Forecasting

### Model Selection

In this phase, i select appropriate time series forecasting models based on the nature of our data. Our model selection includes:

- **SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average):** A robust model that accounts for seasonality, trends, and noise in time series data.
- **ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average):** A model suitable for capturing the autocorrelation and differencing in time series data.

Our model selection is driven by a thoughtful consideration of the dataset's characteristics and business objectives.

### Model Evaluation

Evaluating the accuracy of our forecasting models is crucial. i employ various evaluation metrics, including:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Measuring the average absolute difference betien predicted and actual sales values.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Providing insights into the model's prediction error in relation to actual sales.

Additionally, i employ cross-validation techniques to validate our models and ensure they generalize ill to unseen data.

## Results

The culmination of our analysis and forecasting efforts leads to insightful results:

- **Historical Sales Data Visualizations:** i present visualizations that offer a clear overview of sales patterns and trends over time.
- **Sales Insights:** Key findings and observations from our analysis, including seasonality, trends, and any anomalies detected.
- **Future Sales Forecasts:** Accurate forecasts of future sales based on our selected models.
- **Recommendations:** Actionable recommendations for optimizing inventory management, resource allocation, and overall business strategies based on our insights and forecasts.
